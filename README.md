# Restaurant-Management-System
This is my Database Systems project that I Developed in VS Code using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend APIs.
<br>
This project allows you to place online orders, register customer, view the menu, reserve tables, and leave reviews. 
<br>
We designed a complete frontend and backend system with database schema integration. 
<br>
Postman was used to test and connect APIs for data handling and updates.
